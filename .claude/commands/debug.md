Enter structured debugging mode for the issue I describe.

Follow this process:

1. **Restate the problem** in one sentence to confirm understanding. If anything is ambiguous, ask before proceeding.

2. **Hypotheses** — List 3-5 possible root causes, ranked by likelihood. For each:
   - What could cause this behavior?
   - What evidence would confirm or rule it out?

3. **Investigation plan** — For the top 2 hypotheses, what's the minimal code/log/state I should check first? Be specific about file names, function names, or log lines if you know them.

4. **Proceed** — Start investigating the most likely hypothesis. Show your reasoning as you go. When you find the cause, explain it clearly before writing any fix.

5. **Fix** — Propose the minimal, targeted fix. Don't refactor unrelated things. If the fix has risks or side effects, call them out.

Stay in hypothesis-driven mode. Don't guess randomly or try multiple fixes at once.
